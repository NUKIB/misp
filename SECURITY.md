## Reporting security vulnerabilities

Reporting security vulnerabilities is of great importance for us, as this project is used in multiple critical infrastructures.

In the case of a security vulnerability report, we ask the reporter to send it directly to `cert@nukib.cz`, if possible encrypted with the following PGP key: [`F60C 0622 EE75 52C9 7EE5 E9F8 4405 4AC1 A573 37A6`](https://www.nukib.cz/download/kontakty/cert_pub.asc) or use [Report vulnerability](https://github.com/NUKIB/misp/security/advisories/new) form. We usually fix reported and confirmed security vulnerabilities in less than 72 hours, followed by a software release containing the fixes within the following days.
